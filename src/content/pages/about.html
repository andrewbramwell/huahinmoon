            <h2 class="cs-title">About Hua Hin Moon Thai Massage</h2>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Meet Moon, the founder and principal therapist at Hua Hin Moon Thai Massage, bringing over 15 years of professional massage experience to Sunderland. Originally from Laos, Moon moved to Hua Hin, Thailand at age 22, where she established her expertise in traditional Thai healing arts. Since relocating to the UK in 2009, she has dedicated herself to mastering therapeutic massage through formal British training programmes, earning professional certifications including her VTCT Level 3 Certificate in Thai Massage and membership with the Federation of Holistic Therapists.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Driven by a childhood dream of helping people heal, Moon discovered that therapeutic massage could genuinely transform lives. Her extensive qualifications include specialisations in manual lymphatic drainage, pregnancy massage, warm bamboo massage, and Indian head massage. As a competitor in the World Association of Nuad Thai Championships, Moon has achieved international recognition for her expertise in traditional Thai healing techniques combined with modern professional standards.
            </p>
             <p class="cs-text">
                For 12 years, Hua Hin Moon has served the Sunderland community with exceptional therapeutic care, maintaining medical-grade hygiene standards and providing personalised treatments tailored to each client's needs. Moon's approach focuses on addressing root causes rather than just symptoms, building long-term therapeutic relationships that deliver consistent, measurable results for chronic pain relief, sports injury recovery, and overall wellness maintenance.
