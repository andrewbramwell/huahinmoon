                    Everytime I’m at Moons massage she gives her full effort in making me walk out that door 100% better than I walked in, whether that’s recovering from  injury, relaxing massage or deep one when my muscles are sore from training. 12/10 . Highly recommend. Thanks again moon.

                    Visited due to 3 months of constant pain in shoulder and neck. Can honestly say that after 1 treatment my neck and shoulder feels 100 % better. Can't recommend the place enough and will be visiting again.

                    Fantastic massage. Friendly therapists who are well trained.  They were very caring and work hard to help with your aches and pains.  I particularly liked the fact the took a health history first unlike some other Thai places I have tried.  They also we constantly checking if I was comfortable warm etc. I like the fact you got a hot cloth and ginger tea at the end too as often you are given an ice cold water which just feels wrong.  The treatments are great value for money, they have a loyalty system too and will deffinetly be back.

                    Excellent massage, moon knows her stuff very professional,  tells you what's involved ect,  I had the traditional Thai massage which is a hard massage,  yep it can hurt abit at the time with this one, you can have softer ones but my body was knackered and really tight, I had two hours with her, but dam the next day I could not believe the difference, back pain gone, my movement was 100% better, well worth it,  if you after a professional massage especially if you have aches and pains this is the place,  if you do have pains I would recommend the traditional just take it at time because the results the next day are amazing, thankyou for helping me.

                    Incredibly profession. You can tell that they care about their profession and as far removed from the “reputation’ that the UK has for going to a Thai massage. As a very active outdoors person, a power lifter and being 47, sports related, deep tissue massage is an important part of my process. I have been to several places, some have given good massages, but unfortunately then tried to sell ‘extra.’ Here , from the start was great. I’ve been twice now and will have them as part of my health and care process for the foreseeable.
